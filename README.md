NAT Tunnel v0.02
----------------
If you have access to a server with public IP and unfiltered ports
you can run NAT Tunnel (NT)  server on the server, and NT client
on your box behind NAT.
the server requires 2 open ports: one for communication with the
NT client (--admin), the other for regular clients to connect to
(--public: this is the port you want your users to use).

The NT client opens a connection to the server's admin ip/port.
As soon as the server receives a new connection, it signals the
NT client, which then creates a new tunnel connection to the
server, which is then connected to the desired service on the
NT client's side (--local)

The connection between NT Client and NT Server on the admin
interface is protected by a shared secret against unauthorized use.
An adversary who can intercept packets could crack the secret
if it's of insufficient complexity. At least 10 random
characters and numbers are recommended.

Example:
You have a HTTP server listening on your local machine on port 80.
You want to make it available on your cloud server/VPS/etc's public
IP on port 7000.
We use port 8000 on the cloud server for the control channel.

This is a fork of NAT Tunnel which, through some dirty hax, allows
to bind both public and admin interfaces of the server to the same 
port (and breaks everything else). Useful for some instances where 
you you're only allowed to bind to a specific port.

Server:

    natsrv.py --mode server --secret s3cretP4ss --public 0.0.0.0:8000 --admin 0.0.0.0:8000

Client:

    natsrv.py --mode client --secret s3cretP4ss --local localhost:80 --admin example.com:8000
